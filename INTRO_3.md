## A man can't live of ~~bread~~functions alone

Ok, so we were calling few functions now, but we forgot about all the other basic stuff, like the __if__ statement, the __loops__.

First of all, rye doesn't have any statements, everything is an expression, everything returns something.

```python
if 10 < 100:
   print("10 is less than 100")
```
Do you remember the __do__ function?

```python
do {
   print "10 is less than 100"
}
```
