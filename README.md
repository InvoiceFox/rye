# rye üåæ

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is experimental programming language from [refaktor], looking into new (and borrowed) language ideas with interpreter in Go. ‚ö†Ô∏è

You could peek at [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md), where concepts and ideas are born and logged. The language introduction documents are coming.

## Development and experimentation

Currently, tested on Linux and Mac.

### Builds the rye interpreter

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
 
go build

# Executable
./rye 
```

### Builds the rye interpreter with all current builtins

You can leave just the tags and install just the bindings you want.

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/labstack/echo/middleware \
  github.com/labstack/echo-contrib/session \
  github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk \
  github.com/lib/pq \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 \
  github.com/nats-io/nats.go \
  github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem \
  github.com/tobgu/qframe

go build -tags "b_echo b_gtk b_psql b_nats b_psutil b_qframe" -o ryefull

# Executable
./ryefull 
```

## Docker image

The repository comes with [Docker image](./docker/Dockerfile) that is capable of building rye in its full, 
the final step however then just wraps executable so that the image remains small and nimble.

```bash
docker build -t refaktor/rye -f .docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the rye REPL with:

```bash
docker run -ti refaktor/rye
```

## OSX tips

Ryefull relies on GTK3. So make sure your machine has it.

```bash
brew install pkg-config gtk+3 adwaita-icon-theme
```
