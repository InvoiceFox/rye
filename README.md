# rye üåæ

An experimental programming language, looking into some new and many borrowed language 
ideas with interpreter in Go. ‚ö†

```bash
hello: fn { a } { "Hello" +_ a + "!" }
print hello "world"
// outputs: Hello world!

data: { name "Jim" age 33 }
code: { hello data/name }
if true code
// outputs: Hello Jim!
```

## Examples and more info

A [blog](https://ryelang.blogspot.com/) following development.

The language [introduction](https://refaktor.github.io/rye/INTRO_1.html) are work in progress.

There is also a [simple website](https://refaktor.github.io/rye/) being made.

There is also a very small [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/866313463771373) you can join.

## Platforms

Currently, tested on Linux, Mac and Docker.

### Builds the rye interpreter

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
 
go build

# Executable
./rye 
```

### Builds the rye interpreter with all current builtins

You can leave just the tags and install just the bindings you want.

```bash
go get -v github.com/pkg/profile \
  github.com/yhirose/go-peg \
  github.com/labstack/echo/middleware \
  github.com/labstack/echo-contrib/session \
  github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk \
  github.com/lib/pq \
  github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 \
  github.com/nats-io/nats.go \
  github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem \
  github.com/tobgu/qframe

go build -tags "b_echo b_gtk b_psql b_nats b_psutil b_qframe" -o ryefull

# Executable
./ryefull 
```

## Docker image

The repository comes with [Docker image](./docker/Dockerfile) that is capable of building rye in its full, 
the final step however then just wraps executable so that the image remains small and nimble.

```bash
docker build -t refaktor/rye -f .docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the rye REPL with:

```bash
docker run -ti refaktor/rye
```

## OSX tips

Ryefull relies on GTK3. So make sure your machine has it.

```bash
brew install pkg-config gtk+3 adwaita-icon-theme
```
