# Introducing Rye to Python programmers

### Theory be damned!
#### Nothin' but values
All rye atoms are rye values. Rye has 29 types of values.
#### Block of values
Block is one of the types. It's a list of rye values.
#### Words
Nother type are words. Words are linked to other values. We have different types of words.
#### Native functions
Words can link to native functions.

#### More about native functions
#### Do those blocks again
We can use a native function _do_ to eveluate a block.

#### Express yourself
Everything in do rye dialect are expressions, they always return something.
#### The If function
If if a function accepting a condition and a block to _do_ in case it's true
#### Either like it or don't
Instead of if / else we have a function either. Either works as ternary operator too.
#### All-isms so far
#### Spaces, separators and newlines
Rye do code is blind to spaces, newlines and in general doesn't use separators.

#### Loop functions
Loop and for-each functions example.
#### Map, filter
The FP programming functions example.
#### User functions
Example of creating your own functions. An ordinary native function creates functions.
