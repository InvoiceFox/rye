<h1>Introducing Rye to Python programmers</h1>

<p>Python is a clear, understood language that many people know. So I will use Python examples to introduce you to the Rye language.</p>

<p>But Python and Rye are quite different. All Rye&rsquo;s core ideas are taken from <strong>Rebol</strong>. Words, blocks, code is data, etc..
It also takes some aspirations from <strong>Factor</strong> (a stack based language) and some from your ordinary <strong>linux shell</strong> (pipes).</p>

<h2>Theory be damned!</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>When I say Rye below, I most of the time mean the Do dialect of Rye &hellip; more on that later</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me tell you a little about the basic principles in Rye, so the code forward will make more sense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple, there are no keywords, statements or special forms.</p>

<h2>Nothin&rsquo; but values</h2>

<p>Rye language is currently composed of 29 different types of <strong>values</strong>. Values can be literal values (numbers, strings, dates), words, blocks, etc.</p>

<p>You could say that Rye code is nothing but values and it would be true.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-rye">1
2
&quot;Jim&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Python has 13 data types <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp">[py1]</a>, but it has a lot of other &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Block of Values</h2>

<p>A more interesting type of value is a <strong>block</strong>. Because block holds other values inside. Value of values :)</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>{ 1 2 &quot;Jim&quot; }
{ { &quot;Jim&quot; 33 } { &quot;Jane&quot; 35 } }
</code></pre>

<p>Block is like a list in Python.</p>

<h2>Words</h2>

<p>Probably the most interesting type of value is a <strong>word</strong>. Words can be linked to any other value. Like we saw above,
to numbers, strings, blocks, other words, etc. There are multiple types of words, actually. First two we will meet
are <strong>set-words</strong> and just ordinary <strong>words</strong>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>age: 101
description: &quot;wise&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The colon on the right identifies a <strong>set-word</strong>. A set word in Rye evaluates expression on the right and
sets the value of it to that word.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>print age
101
print description
wise
</code></pre>

<p>Ordinary <strong>words</strong> like <em>age</em> and <em>description</em> just return the values they are linked to.</p>

<p>So, words are similar to variables in Python. And what is <strong>print</strong> then?</p>

<h2>Native functions</h2>

<p><strong>print</strong> above looks a lot like the words (<em>age</em> and <em>description</em>) and it is a word. But this word is
linked to another type of value, a <strong>native function</strong>.</p>

<p>Native function behind <em>print</em> accepts 1 argument, so rye evaluates expression on the right to get that value.
Then the native prints it.</p>

<p>Better late than never, now would be a good time to do:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>print &quot;Hello world!&quot;
Hello world
</code></pre>

<p>Ok. Enough theory for now. Let&rsquo;s compare some python and rye code next.</p>
