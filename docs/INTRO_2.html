<h2>More about native functions</h2>

<p>With all we know so far let&rsquo;s translate few Python snippets:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">name = &quot;Jim&quot;
print(name)
</code></pre>

<p>In rye this becomes code below. Notice the set-word instead of equals and lack of parenthesis after function call.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">name: &quot;Jim&quot;
print name
</code></pre>

<p>Here we make a list, join items of it with a separator and print the result.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">names = [ &quot;Jim&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot; ]
print(&quot;, &quot;.join(names))
</code></pre>

<p>In rye, we make a <em>block</em> (notice the lack of commas) then we join and print the result.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">names: { &quot;Jim&quot; &quot;Jane&quot; }
print join names &quot;, &quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If you were a lisper, second line would look like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">(print (join names &quot;, &quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>If you were in ptyhon or javascript it would be written like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">print(join(names, &quot;, &quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>As we see Rye doesn&rsquo;t use parenhesis for function calls. Each word that is a function evaluates and &ldquo;consumes&rdquo; as much values
to the right as it needs. That&rsquo;s why in Rye all functions must accept a fixed numbers of arguments.</p>

<h2><em>Do</em> those blocks again</h2>

<p>We used a list above and called it a block. As python lists, rye blocks can hold different types of values, any types of values:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">some_list = [ &quot;Jim&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, 33, 12.5 ]
</code></pre>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">some-block: { &quot;Jim&quot; &quot;Jane&quot; 33 12.5 }
</code></pre>

<p>But remember, rye has 29 types of values. One of them, absolutely equal to the other types are <strong>words</strong>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">a-block: { print join names &quot;, &quot; }
</code></pre>

<p>So we have a <em>list</em> that looks like code, but what good is this now? Well, we have this <strong>do</strong> native function that <em>does</em> a block.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">do a-block
Jim, Jane
</code></pre>

<p>This looks similar to python&rsquo;s or Javascript&rsquo;s <strong>eval</strong> function. There is a major difference though, those two evaluate a <strong>string</strong>
that looks like javascript. Here we <em>do</em> the already parsed, loaded and &ldquo;alive&rdquo; <strong>rye values</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, there is no difference in evaluation of the code we wrote so far and the code inside <em>a-block</em>. And the <em>do</em> we called is no
different from the <em>do</em> that does <strong>all our code</strong>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">do {
  do {
    names: { &quot;Jim&quot; &quot;Jane&quot; }
    do {
      do a-block
      Jim, Jane
    }
  }
} // .....
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you would have a python&rsquo;s lists and your code is also just a python&rsquo;s list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote from the first chapter, about all Rye here being just the <em>Do dialect</em> makes a little more sense now. In fact, Rye (as <strong>Rebol</strong> - they
invented all this) is a data description language (think JSON). And it has many interpreters of that data, one of them is the <strong>do</strong> function,
the <strong>do dialect</strong>.</p>
