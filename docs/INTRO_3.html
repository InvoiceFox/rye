<h2>Express yourself</h2>

<p>So we tried calling few functions so far, but we forgot about all the other basic stuff, like the <strong>if</strong> statement, the <strong>loops</strong>.</p>

<p>First of all, rye doesn&rsquo;t have any statements, everything is an expression, <strong>everything returns something</strong>.</p>

<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t need explicit <strong>return</strong> statements, the result of last expression in the block is returned. A little weird piece
of code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">print 100 + do { print 1 print 11 }
1
11
111
</code></pre>

<p>The last expression in a block is <code>print 11</code>, print returns the value it prints, so the do returns 11. You can figure out the rest.</p>

<h2>The If function</h2>

<p>In most languages <strong>if</strong> is a statement, or a <strong>special form</strong>, feature of the language. Even in Lisps, if is a macro.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">if 10 &lt; 100:
   print(&quot;10 is less than 100&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Rye doesn&rsquo;t evaluate blocks by default, so they can be ordinary arguments. <em>Do</em> you remember the <strong>do</strong> function? I accepts the
block of code as a first argument.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">do {
   print &quot;10 is less than 100&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could there be a similar function, but it would <em>do</em> the code (now second argument) only if the first argument
would be true? Of course &hellip;</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">if 10 &lt; 100 {
   print &quot;10 is less than 100&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If <strong>if</strong> is just a function, it means you can make your own if-like functions inside rye.</p>

<h2>Either do or don&rsquo;t</h2>

<p>The downside of this is that in Rye we can&rsquo;t have special forms like <strong>if &hellip; else &hellip;.</strong>, because <em>we don&rsquo;t
have special forms at all</em>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">if name == &quot;Jim&quot;:
   print(&quot;Hi Jim&quot;)
else:
   print(&quot;Door is locked&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>So we have a function called <strong>either</strong>, that takes additional block as argument.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">either name = &quot;Jim&quot; {
   print &quot;hi Jim&quot;
} {
   print &quot;Door is locked&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>See, it&rsquo;s not so bad. But because everything is a function call it makes a language much more uniform,
simpler and malleable.</p>

<p>And I said, everything in Rye retuns something, so the example above would be better written as:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">print either name = &quot;Jim&quot; { &quot;hi Jim&quot; } { &quot;Door is locked&quot; }
</code></pre>

<h2>All-isms so far</h2>

<ul>
<li>All rye code and data is composed of (nested) rye values</li>
<li>All evaluation elements return something, are expressions</li>
<li>All active words in Rye are functions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spaces, separators and newlines</h2>

<p>There is another stark difference between Rye (and Rebol) and most other programming languages. Rye code
doesn&rsquo;t need separators (between elements or end of line), parenthesis and is absolutely space and newline unsensitive.
You could write entire Rye program in one line (without any separators) or type in each Rye code element it it&rsquo;s own
line for example.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">print &quot;jim&quot; print add 1 inc 2 // is the same as 

print
&quot;jim&quot; print
add 1
inc
2
// both will print:
// jim
// 4
</code></pre>

<p>This can be seen as a blessing or a curse, I am just saying how it is. Rye (not Rebol)
has aditional concept of expression guards, so you can (for your certanty) in some cases where it&rsquo;s usefull, use commas between
top level expressions if you want to make certain they are separated.</p>

<p>Here you could use them like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">print &quot;jim&quot; , print add 1 inc 2  
</code></pre>

<p>Rye tries to keep and sometimes increase the flexibility of Rebol, while also improve <strong>certainty</strong>. Expression guards are a small
addition in that direction.</p>
