<h2>Loop functions</h2>

<p>Python has (with combination of iterators and range function) a powerfull and versatile <strong>for loop statement</strong>.
It can iterate over a collection of items, loop over numbers, ranges, etc.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">for x in range(5):
    print(x)

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
for prime in primes:
    print(prime)
</code></pre>

<p>Rye takes a different approach here. Because loop constructs are <strong>again just functions</strong> in Rye, you can have many of them,
you can make our own, they can be defined in libraries which you can load if you need them.</p>

<p>Rye has less verbose equivavlents of the code above, which we will meet once we know <strong>op-words</strong>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">loop 5 { .print }

primes: { 2 3 5 7 }
for primes { .print }
</code></pre>

<p>But it also has more python / rebol like equivalents:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">repeat 'i 5 { print i }

primes: { 2 3 5 7 }
for-each 'prime primes { print prime }
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <em>repeat</em> and <em>for-each</em> are functions, both take 3 arguments. A word to set in each iteration, a value to iterate over or to and a block of code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lit-word is another type of word. It means it doesn&rsquo;t evalueate to the value the word is linked to but to literal word itself.
&lsquo;i and &lsquo;prime are lit-words above.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Map, Reduce, Filter</h2>

<p>You probably heard of these three. They are 3 popular higher order functions in <em>funcional programming</em> languages. Semi functional languages have them also,
like Javascript and Python. Python is not particularly strong on FP side, Javascript is a little better. Let&rsquo;s look at map &hellip;</p>

<p>These are functions in javascript and python too. That&rsquo;s why they are a little more limited.</p>

<p>Map <em>maps</em> a list of items to new list of items given some (usually anonymous) function.</p>

<p>Map function is passed an anonymous function.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-javascript">const items = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
const doubled = items.map(functionx(x) { return x * 2 });
const lower = items.filter(functionx(x) { return x &lt; 4 });
</code></pre>

<p>Newer Javascript has a shorthand syntax for anonymous functions, so it can be written like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-javascript">const doubled = items.map(x =&gt; x * 2);
const lower = items.filter(x =&gt; x &lt; 4);
</code></pre>

<p>Python also has map <strong>function</strong>, and a concept of lambda function, which is a small anonymous function that can only have one expression.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, items))
lower = list(filter(lambda x: x &lt; 4, items))
</code></pre>

<p>Rye standard library has map-each (and map) too</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">items: { 1 2 3 4 5 }
doubled: map-each 'x items { x * 2 }  // this is normal block, not limited to 1 expression like in python
lower: filter-each 'x items { x &gt; 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>Map each can take an anonymous function as third argument like the javascript or python above, but it can also take a block of code, which is
less verbose and more lighterweight.</p>

<p>When we get to <strong>op-words</strong> and &ldquo;injected blocks&rdquo;, we will also be able to use map function</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">items: { 1 2 3 4 5 }
doubled: map items { * 2 }
lower: filter items { * 2 }
</code></pre>

<h2>User functions</h2>

<p>This is how you define your (user) functions in Python:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">def greet(name):
    print(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;)

# and call it
greet(&quot;Jane&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>And not so differently in Rye:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-factor">greet: fn { name } {
    print &quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;
}

# and call it
greet &quot;Jane&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>There are some differences behind the scenes though
* as always, set-word sets word <em>greet</em> to the result of the expression on the right
* <strong>fn</strong> is a function, that returns a <strong>user function value</strong>, it accepts 2 arguments, two blocks
    * first block is a argument list (a spec, it can include more than just arguments)
    * second block is code / function body</p>

<p>And yet again. <strong>fn</strong> is just a function, we could and do have many of those. For example <em>fnc</em>
that also accepts a context in which a function runs, a <em>closure</em>, and library specific ones.</p>
