  <h1>ðŸŒ¾ Rye language</h1>
  
  <p>Rye is a <b>work in progress</b> programming language based on ideas from Rebol, with some aspirations from Factor and Linux shell.</p>

  <p>Rye is a high level, homoiconic, dynamic language. Currently implemented as an interpreter in Go. It's basic elements are determined, but many are still in test and design stage.</p>  

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      hello: fn { a } { "Hello" +_ a + "!" }
      print hello "world"
      // outputs: Hello world!
  </code></pre>

  <p>Rye is basically a data description language (think JSON) with over 30 data types and multiple dialects (interpreters) over that data (think executable JSON).</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      person: { name "Jim" age 33 }
      code: { hello person/name }
      if true code
      // outputs: Hello Jim!
  </code></pre>

  <p>It has no keywords, no special forms, every active word in it's main dialect (+, *, if, for-each, fn, class, return) is a
    function and determined on a "library level" (you can load libraries with different ones or write your own). It has many types of words though.</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      _+\: fn { a b } { a + "\n" + b }
      hello "pipe-words" +\ "and op-words!" .capitalize |print
      // outputs: Hello pipe-words!
      //          And op-words!
  </code></pre>

  <p>It's native functions aren't only control structures, "special forms", but can also be <b>their own interpreters</b> (dialects). One example is validate
  function and it's validation-dialect.</p>

  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      { num 100 }
      |validate {
        name: optional "joedoe" string calc { .capitalize }
        num: required integer check "too-low" { > 50 }
      } |probe
      // outputs: { name "Joedoe" num 100 }
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Not in public mode!</h3>
  
  <p>The language development is still fully in "cave mode". 
    <b>No bigger publicity is desired at this stage</b>. This page is here, so it helps me think and communicate thigs.</p>
